Improvements:

- Supported for a multiline command argument.
- Changed file name of all working files (e.g. log, cookie and pid) which has a port number as suffix.
- Tearing down the user-specified classpath at the end of each script invocation.
- Made exit status use positive number (because, for example, "-1" happened to be displayed like "255").
- Supported to build by Maven3.

Bug Fixes:

          <h2>Changes in version 0.5 (2010-12-22)</h2>
          <pre>
New Features:

 - Now groovyclient can take -C prefix options which are interpreted
   on groovyclient itself (don't pass to groovy command).
 - '-Cr/-Ck' client options restart/stop groovyserver process(Mac OS X and
   Linux only). By using these options you can control groovyserver
   through groovyclient.
 - With '-Cenv' option of groovyclient, we can pass the environment
   variables which name matches with the specified pattern to
   groovyserver. The values of matched variables on the client process
   are sent to the server process, and the values of same name
   environment variable on the server are set to or overwitten by the
   passed values. This feature is especially useful for IDEs' which
   uses environment variables to pass configuration information with
   invoking external command which is written Groovy. Textmate is one
   of those IDEs reportedly.
 - Option '-Cenv-all' makes to pass all environment variables of the client
   process to groovyserver. And option '-Cenv-exclude' excludes variables
   which name matches with the specified pattern.
 - You can specify port number easily by using -Cp/-Cport options and
   handle multiple groovyserver instance distinguished by the port
   number.

Improvements:

 - Groovyserver's starting messages are now emit to stderr, so use of
   pipe or redirection is more useful with Groovy scripting. Moreover
   -Cq/-Cqiuet options suppresses starting message of groovyserver.
 - Groovyserver now emit informative messages about GroovyServ's
   installed directory and which groovy command are used. This is
   useful for trouble shooting.
 - [Only Linux/Mac OS X]Now GROOVY_HOME environment variable become
   optional. Supported some ways to find a groovy command in the
   following order: (1)from PATH environment variable. (2)as
   GROOVY_HOME/bin/groovy. If not exists, a intent revealing message
   is emitted to the console.

Bug fixes:

 - Groovyclient can't invoke groovyserver when GroovyServ is installed
   on a directory which name includes white spaces(e.g. 'C:/Program
   Files/...).
 - On Linux, if the GroovyServ installed to the directory with
   symbolic link, it didn't work. (because of Linux's which command
   don't support -s option so we changed the implementation to do it
   without -s.)
 - In Mac OS X, progress showing mark displayed '-n .' instead of '...'.

          <pre>
New Features:

- groovyserver.bat shows a window which can be used to stop the server in Windows.

Improvements:

- Supported -p, -n options of groovyclient (See help of groovy command).
- And you can also execute the following command:
    $ ls | groovyclient -e "System.in.eachLine{ println it }"
- Filters written in Groovy works well.
- Using a environment variable USERPROFILE instead of HOME in Windows.
- Improved support of invoking groovyserver on Cygwin.
- Improved a process of invoking groovyserver.
- Packaged not-compiled Groovy scripts into jar file in order not to depend on a particular JDK version.
- Printing help message when groovyclient is run without options.
- Appended date and time in debug log.

Bug Fixes:

- Cannot print nothing after an error about pipe occurred once.
- Segmentation fault occurs with too long arguments.
- Some bugs makes segmentation faults around communication handling is fixed.
- Fix for ignored CLASSPATH environment variable in groovyclient.rb
- Fix for a unified way of specifying port number.

Improvements:

- Refactored groovyclient.c a little.
- Tweaked handling of character encoding in a build sequence.
    you can use either of the following:
      - default encoding (without -Dfile.encoding in JAVA_OPTS, _JAVA_OPTIONS)
      - global encoding with -Dfile.encoding in _JAVA_OPTIONS (recommend: UTF-8)
- README has URL of the site of GitHub (and README.ja was deleted).
- Upgraded Groovy 1.7.2 -&gt; 1.7.3.
- Upgraded gmaven 1.2 -&gt; 1.3-SNAPSHOT (because GMAVEN-13 was fixed).
- All tests result green in Windows environment.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed that groovyserver.bat doesn't start up through groovyclient in Windows.
- Fixed that loop count is wrong while starting server in groovyclient.c.

New Features:

- Independence from cygwin.dll on Windows environment.  Now it can be compiled with MinGW.
- Added batch file version groovyserver startup script (for uses on Windows who don't want to install Cygwin).

Improvements:

- Wholly refactored implementation.
- Added unit tests and integration tests (some of integration tests are a little fragile still now).
- Output more informative log with -v option.
- All log output to ./groovy/groovyserv/groovyserver.log.
