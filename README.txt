After you build html files, copy and apply to the gh-pages branch.

You need https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github in order to build for gh-pages.

Before you build docs, you must install sphinx and sphinxtogithub as follows:

e.g.
    $ sudo easy_install sphinx
    $ sudo  easy_install -U sphinxtogithub
